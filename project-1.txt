My name is Advait Anil Joshi. I am a third year Biomedical Engineering student,
specializing in cell and tissue engineering. I am from Mumbai, India, but "home"
is a complex word for me, as I grew up partly in Saudi Arabia, and currently my
family lives in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. As much as I like to say that
I speak Arabic, I cannot speak or understand any more than the basics, such as
"hello", "goodbye", "how are you" and other stuff required while shopping.

What I hope to learn from this class is a way to present myself to the world
that is different from resumes and cover letters. But, that is not my only
ambition. I hope to learn about how building webpages works, as right now all
I see is code and words I do not understand.

I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree, but I definitely want to pursue a
Master's degree. My desire to earn a Master's is because I want to be educated
and knowledgeable, the added average salary Master's graduates earn is just an
added plus :D.
