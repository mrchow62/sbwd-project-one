<h1>Who is Advait?</h1>

<p>
  My name is Advait Anil Joshi. I am a third year Biomedical Engineering student,
  specializing in cell and tissue engineering. I am from Mumbai, India, but "home"
  is a complex word for me, as I grew up partly in Saudi Arabia, and currently my
  family lives in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. As much as I like to say that
  I speak Arabic, I cannot speak or understand any more than the basics, such as
  "hello", "goodbye", "how are you" and other stuff required while shopping.
</p>

<p>
  What I hope to learn from this class is a way to present myself to the world
  in a way that is different from resumes and cover letters. But, that is not
  my only ambition. I hope to learn about how building webpages works, as right
  now all I see is code and words I do not understand.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree, but I definitely want to pursue a
  Master's degree. My desire to earn a Master's is because I want to be educated
  and knowledgeable, the added average salary Master's graduates earn is just an
  added plus :D. I am currently considering the option of doing a co-terminal
  program here at IIT.
