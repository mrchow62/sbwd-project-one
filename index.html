<h1>Who is Advait?</h1>
<article id="content">

<p>
  My name is Advait Anil Joshi. I am a third year Biomedical Engineering student, specializing in
  cell and tissue engineering. I am from Mumbai, India, but "home" is a complex word for me, as I
  grew up partly in Saudi Arabia, and currently my family lives in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
  As much as I like to say that I speak Arabic, I cannot speak or understand any more than the
  basics, such as "hello", "goodbye", "how are you" and other stuff required while shopping.

<p>
  What I hope to learn from this class is a way to present myself to the world in a way that is
  different from resumes and cover letters. But, that is not my only ambition. I hope to learn about
  how building webpages works, as right now all I see is code and words I do not understand.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree, but I definitely want to pursue a Master's degree. My
  desire to earn a Master's is because I want to be educated and knowledgeable, the added average
  salary Master's graduates earn is just an added plus :D. I am currently considering the option of
  doing a co-terminal program here at IIT.
